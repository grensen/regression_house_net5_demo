# Neural Regression House Price Inference Demo


The goal of a regression problem is to predict a single numeric value. 

The inference demo here based on the article [Neural Regression Classification Using PyTorch](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2021/02/02/pytorch-prepare.aspx). 
In preparation for that, the demo uses a neural network which was trained on the training data. Sample and test data was also taken from the article to inference the trained model.

The algorithm for the demo looks like this:
```
1. load neural network from file
2. create neural network logic
3. init neural network parms
4. load trained weights
5. load test data
6. test model
7. predict sample
8. done
```
Thats the result :-)

The requierement of .NET 5 core is needed to run the demo in Visual Studio. 
If there is a problem, StackOverflow is the first place to get help, also when there are some problems to run this demo.
